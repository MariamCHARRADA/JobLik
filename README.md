## Architecture 💼

</p>

Here's how these components work together:

Users interact with the frontend to request or offer services.

The frontend sends these requests to the backend via APIs.

The backend processes the requests, interacts with the database, and performs necessary operations.

Responses from the backend are sent back to the frontend to inform the user of the outcome.

This architecture ensures a separation of concerns, with the frontend focused on user interaction and the backend on data management and business logic.
